We are a Zendesk Master Partner specialised in integrating external platforms into Zendesk and making external data available to agents in Zendesk.

# What we do
## Zendesk Sidebar Apps
We build integrations for existing systems our customers use for Zendesk. These are almost always sidebar apps in Zendesk Support or Sell that link back via API to external sources.

- Get data from external API sources (CSV, HTTP API, SOAP,..)
- Show data in an HTML frame powered by Javascript/JQuery
- Allow agents to push data back to the external system

## Data migrations
Our customers often come from existing platforms where they host tickets, FAQ content or scripts. 

- Get data from existing platforms or CSV files
- Convert them to data compatible with Zendesk
- Import into Zendesk using the Zendesk API
- E.g. import tickets, users, Help Center articles

## Automations
Although Zendesk has an extensive [marketplace](https://zendesk.com/marketplace), some integrations require a custom script to run regularly to get data and reports to and from Zendesk.
We also invest heavily in automation deployments of our 'best practices' to new customer environments by leveraging the Zendesk API.

- Purpose built web applications that automate parts of our workflow
- Deploy best practice setups to client environments
- Create and restore configuration backups from client environments

## State of the art
Being a Master Integration Partner gives us access to a lot of EAP for the Zendesk Suite. We try go get the new features and API integrated into our offerings when they go live for all customers.

- Build proof of concept use cases for new Zendesk technologies
- Build missing Zendesk functionality via Zendesk (Marketplace) Apps

# What we often build
Below is a typical setup as requested by our clients.

## Basic requirements
- Their data lives in a database accessible via API
- They want to be able to search or filter that data
- Based on our search or filter we get a list of matches
- We retrieve one of those matches and show the contents of the object in a sidebar app.

## Zendesk specifics
- Matched objects can often be prefiltered based on metadata in the ticket (email, organization, name, custom field value,..)
- Once a match is selected we store a reference in a linked ticket field so the ticket will retrieve the value automatically the next time
- Design of the app makes uses of the [Zendesk Garden framework](https://garden.zendesk.com)

# How we work
Our development team is currently two developers and two external teams. We work autonomously on projects from concept to delivered product. Before going live the other team members review the app or integration and can give feedback or create issues.

We work mostly remote with online status meetings, and meet on a regular basis in our offices in Antwerp (if COVID restrictions allow) to catch up and discuss projects.

We develop as part of an existing customer project that contains Zendesk configuration, Help Center themes, custom sidebar apps, data migrations and integrations with existing platforms.
All development for customer tools starts and stops during the project and changes are made by request of a customer in a new project.
